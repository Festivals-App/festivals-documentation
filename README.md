## Working Language

We want to be as open and transparent as possible, also to interested parties in the global developer community who do not speak German. Consequently, all content will be made available primarily in _English_. We also ask all interested people to use English as language to create issues, in their code (comments, documentation etc.) and when you send requests to us. The application itself, documentation and all end-user facing content will - of course - be made available in German (and probably other languages as well). We also try to make developer documentation available in German, but please understand that focussing on the _Lingua Franca_ of the global developer community makes the development of this application as efficient as possible.

## Our Documentation

This repository contains the developer documentation and related content.

### Project Scope

### Technical Documentation

The technical documents are intended for a technical audience and represent the most recent state of the architecture. The solution architecture and concepts might change over time as external dependencies (e.g. the framework provided by Apple/Google) are still changing and new requirements need to be included or existing ones change. We appreciate feedback to all elements of these technical documents.
