# General Deployment Notes

I want to make the festivals-app project as (vendor) independend and flexible as possible. To reach that goal
i try to use open-source and standardized software everywhere that is possible and indicated. Some vendor dependencies
are unavoidable: there is just no way to publish an iOS app without being completely dependend on Apple. 
Some dependencies are self inflicted, i started as a macOS developer so it is fastest for me to develope 
some of the tooling for macOS.
