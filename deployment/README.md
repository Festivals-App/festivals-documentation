# General Deployment Notes

I want to make the festivals-app project as (vendor) independend and flexible as possible. To reach that goal
i try to use open-source and standardized software everywhere that is possible and indicated. Some vendor dependencies
are unavoidable: there is just no way to publish an iOS app without being completely dependend on Apple.
Some dependencies are self inflicted, i started as a macOS developer so it is fastest for me to develop
some of the tooling for macOS.

## Deploying the FestivalsApp Backend

Deploying the FestivalsApp backend requires setting up the necessary infrastructure to ensure a stable, scalable,
and maintainable environment. This involves provisioning virtual machines (VMs) or containerized environments,
configuring networking, managing dependencies, and ensuring security best practices.

Other key aspects of deployment include monitoring, logging, and automation to streamline updates and maintenance.
Security considerations, such as access control and data protection, also play a crucial role in ensuring a robust deployment.
This guides provide an overview of the different components and steps required to deploy the FestivalsApp backend,
offering guidance on best practices and available options.
