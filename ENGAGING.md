## Engaging in the FestivalsApp project

I use GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request, addressing me (with `@Phisto`) in the description of the pull request.

* If you plan to do something more involved, please reach out to me and send an [email](mailto:simon.cay.gaus@gmail.com). This will avoid unnecessary work.


## Issues and Planning

I use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancement requests.

* Please provide as much context as possible when you open an issue. The information you provide must be comprehensive enough to reproduce that issue for the assignee. Therefore, contributors should use but aren't restricted to the issue template provided by the project maintainers.

* When creating an issue, try using one of our issue templates which already contain some guidelines on which content is expected to process the issue most efficiently. If no template applies, you can of course also create an issue from scratch.

* Please apply one or more applicable [labels](https://github.com/Festivals-App/festivals-documentation/labels) to your issue so that all community members are able to cluster the issues better.

## Steps to Contribute

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on the GitHub issue that you want to work on. This is to prevent duplicated efforts from other contributors on the same issue.

If you have questions about one of the issues, please comment on them.

## Contributing Code

You are welcome to contribute code in order to fix a bug or to implement a new feature or contribute documentation.

* Contributions must be licensed under the [LGPL-3.0](LICENSE)

## Pull Request Checklist

* Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with master, you may be asked to rebase your changes.

* Commits should be as small as possible while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).

* Test your changes as thoroughly as possible before you commit them. Preferably, automate your test by unit/integration tests. If tested manually, provide information about the test scope in the PR description (e.g. “Test passed: Upgrade version from 0.42 to 0.42.23.”).
* 
* If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a comment, or you can ask for a review by contacting me via [email](mailto:simon.cay.gaus@gmail.com).
